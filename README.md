‚ùÑÔ∏è This flake exposes a `datomic-pro` nix package and several NixOS modules for running Datomic Pro on NixOS.

> üêã Looking for a container / docker image instead? Check out my other repo [ramblurr/containers](https://github.com/Ramblurr/containers/tree/main/apps/datomic-pro).

## Usage

### `flake.nix`

```nix
{
  inputs.
   inputs = {
        nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
        datomic-pro.url = "https://flakehub.com/f/Ramblurr/datomic-pro/*.tar.gz";
        datomic-pro.nixpkgs = "nixpkgs";
    };
    outputs = { nixpkgs, datomic-pro, ... }@attrs: {
        nixosConfigurations.machine = nixpksg.lib.nixosSystem {
            system = "x86_64-linux";
            modules = [
                ./configuration.nix
                datomic-pro.nixosModules.${system}.datomic-pro
            ];
        };
    };
}

```

### `/etc/datomic-pro/secrets.properties`

I wouldn't really do this in production I would use a tool like
[agenix](https://github.com/ryantm/agenix) or
[sops-nix](https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix).

Whatever you do, do not use
[`environment.etc`](https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=24.05&show=environment.etc&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=environment.etc)
to create the secret files! That will write the secrets into the globally
readable nix store, and could end up on a nix cache somewhere. Bad news!

``` java-properties
# in `/etc/datomic-pro/secrets.properties`
storage-admin-password=changeme
storage-datomic-password=changeme
```

``` shell
# set permissions carefully, it just needs to be root owned
# even though datomic doesn't run as root (thanks systemd!)
chown root:root /etc/datomic-pro/secrets.properties
chmod 0600 /etc/datomic-pro/secrets.properties
```

### `configuration.nix`

A basic dev-mode datomic that stores its state in `/var/lib/datomic-pro`:

``` nix
{
    services.datomic-pro = {
        secretsFile = "/etc/datomic-pro/secrets.properties";
        settings = {
            # no secrets in here!
            enable = true;
            host = "localhost";
            port = 4334;
            memory-index-max = "256m";
            memory-index-threshold = "32m";
            object-cache-max = "128m";
            protocol = "dev";
            storage-access = "remote";
        };
    }
    # optionally add the console

    services.datomic-console = {
        enable = true;
        port = 8080;
        dbUriFile = ..path to secret file containing something like datomic:dev://localhost:4334/.....
    };

    # ... the rest of your owl ...
}
```
